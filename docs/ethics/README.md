# Ethics & Participant Safety

We prioritize ocular safety, privacy, and data minimization. All sessions enforce RSU caps, scheduled breaks, and immediate stop rules at discomfort. Video/eye data are anonymized with hashed IDs; raw frames should remain local when feasible. This folder tracks approvals, consent templates, and risk assessments.
